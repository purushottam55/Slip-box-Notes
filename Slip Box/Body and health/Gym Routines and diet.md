===========Choosing Split===========
#exercise #LegDay 

✅ Weekly Training Split (Goal: Size & Definition)

🦵 Monday to Friday – Focus on Lacking Parts (High Priority)

Day	Focused Muscles

Mon	Quads + Calves + Abs
Tue	Shoulders (Front + Side) + Abs
Wed	Glutes + Hamstrings + Calves
Thu	Shoulders (Rear + Traps) + Abs
Fri	Quads + Calves + Abs
![[]]

💪 Saturday – Defined Parts (Maintenance & Shape)

| Focus: Biceps (with forearms), Triceps, Chest, Back |


---

🔥 Split Logic

Legs & Shoulders get trained twice or more per week to grow size.

Abs & Calves hit 3–4x for faster development.

Saturday combines strong parts for keeping them sharp without overtraining.



---

🧠 Notes for Max Growth:
#bodytips #pushYourself #exercise 

Focus on progressive overload + full range of motion.

Prioritize mind-muscle connection, especially on lagging parts.

Use supersets on abs, calves, and forearms for efficiency.

Fuel recovery with high protein + good sleep.


Visualize doin exercise Gym. Its also equally effective as Doing gym.  #exercise
