Top 10 Lessons from *Unfuck* Yourself* – Gary John Bishop

---

### 1. **I Am Willing**  
You don’t need to “feel like it.” Action doesn’t need motivation—just willingness.

---

### 2. **I Am Wired to Win**  
You are always winning at something—even if it’s self-sabotage. Shift what you're “winning” at.

---

### 3. **I Got This**  
Confidence is built by doing. Trust your ability to face anything, one step at a time.

---

### 4. **I Embrace the Uncertainty**  
You grow through discomfort. Embrace risk, messiness, and the unknown—that’s where progress lives.

---

### 5. **I Am Not My Thoughts**  
Negative thoughts will come—observe them, but don’t obey them. You are not your mental noise.

---

### 6. **I Am What I Do**  
Forget intentions—your actions define who you are. Do what aligns with your goals.

---

### 7. **I Am Relentless**  
Success isn’t about talent—it’s about persistence. Keep going even when it’s hard or boring.

---

### 8. **I Expect Nothing and Accept Everything**  
Drop entitlement. Life owes you nothing—accept what is, and move forward from there.

---

### 9. **Language Shapes Reality**  
Watch how you speak to yourself. Your words create your mindset and shape your life.

---

### 10. **Freedom Is Responsibility**  
You’re in charge of your choices, reactions, and direction. Own it—no more excuses.
