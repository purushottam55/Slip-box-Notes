# About information 

Regular discarding unnecessary information is equally important as grasping new one. #awareness 

I am like a water. Random. Formless. And i consider randomness.


# Key Questions :

# Doubt hnn 
Deep seek Ai :
##### see i want ask you what effect i put on my colleagues. I behaves like a fool and cool and Chill but for some peoples i shows responsible by chilled way working. in another time I feel i have super control over them and i also make fun of them.        tell in consize way by analysing 

Your mixed demeanor likely creates a **polarizing effect**:  
- **Positive**: Colleagues may see you as approachable, fun, and stress-relieving, while respecting your competence ("chill responsibility").  
- **Risks**: Overdoing humor/control can undermine authority, breed resentment (if teasing feels mean-spirited), or confuse others about when to take you seriously.  

**Key balance**: Stay authentic but calibrate—ensure playfulness doesn’t overshadow reliability, and "control" leans into mentorship, not manipulation.

In simple words

You come across as **fun and relaxed**, which makes people enjoy working with you. But sometimes, your jokes or control might make them feel **disrespected or unsure** if you’re serious.  

**Best approach**: Keep the chill vibe but know when to switch to serious mode so people trust and respect you fully
