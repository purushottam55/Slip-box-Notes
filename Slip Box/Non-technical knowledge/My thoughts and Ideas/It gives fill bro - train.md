# Some Selftalk lines
#selftalk #pushYourself 
- no matter what going to happen i will reach there anyway, no matter how much pain i may going to suffer
- They follow my path, i takes üíØ% responsibility of the situation 

- no matter what happens i never go back on my words.
- no matter what happens i will make it happen.
- **I am here to position myself. And ready to stand alone for myself. No matter whoever is in front of me.**
( Are you ready to stand for yourself).
- it always about what matters to me.
- Untill i push nothing is possible.


I am afraid of my previous silly excuses.

Is the thing ? I really don't want to be successful.

I will accept pain of doing rather than not doing ( Its so painfull)

Even it is so hard, i am going to do it anyway.
