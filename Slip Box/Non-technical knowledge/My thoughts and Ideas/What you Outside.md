## What you outside


Your outside representation of you is your inner thoughts at that movement.
What you think, talks inside, fills inside that is actually reflected outside always. And you don't even feel that movement. You just think of this thing → this happening in my mind and I am getting overwhelmed.
Everything is what you believe deep inside. So what to do to make change. See the action below mentioned.

#exercise 
Simple formula : 
Just feel inside what you want to be or how you would like to be. The outer self automatically heals and will come into a new reality.
No matter what's your reality is before. May it contain serious tension, lot fuck, May be you are super overwhelmed, Or super fustrated. If you do it ❤️‍🩹 well you will come in new consciousness/reality.


Ex. Jaise imagine karo ki your inside one is super happy and super cool, photo nikalate samay bhi tum ise kar sakte ho. Tume khush aur jo soch rahe ho vah banane se duniya ki koi takad nahi rok sakati. Aksar ham jo sochate hai vahi ban jate hai.

Aur thoda depth me kar loge jaise. Andar vala insan(tumhari image/healthy version of you )  khub has raha hai, khil raha hai, cool attitude ko dekho, us smartness ko dekho, us shant mind ko dekho, us theharav ko dekho. 

Vaha kya work kar raha voh details me dekho. 😂Jaruri nahi tum bhi vaisehi ban jao bas dekho, 😅 koi chij rokh hi nahi sakati tumhe us state of mind me jane se. (Its like decoding the code, and recompiling). ( Tum kitanahi uparvale man se na mano ki tum voh nahi ho usase ghanta farak nahi padta, actual feeling aur mind level par changes reflect ho jate hai par aisa hohi aisa jaruri nahi. Be aware )

## Note -
1)  During the process kuch bhi banane ki chesta mat karo. Bas us andar ke naughty super intelligent insan ko dekho kaise vah behave aur act kar raha hai.
 2) When you are -ve state of mind often come -ve thoughts in inside person also replace. The. Force to be Cool, happy for inner person😅
Decode- Every filling is a chemical as per my understanding. So is exercise se tum inner chemistry ke master ban sakate ho

Yaha imagination aur feeling chalengi thinking avoid karana better rahega.
Forget what you lastly. How much you helpless or burned out or hate yourself.
