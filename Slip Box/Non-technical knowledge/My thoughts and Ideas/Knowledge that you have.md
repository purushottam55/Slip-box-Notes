# Self Explore vs Book -- Mystory
Chalo ek kissa me apani life me experience kiya hua batata hun. Mene 2018 se lekar 2024 tak yani ki 5+ year diaries kuch writting’s likhe. Mene itane hath pair mare, jaise bahot sare implementation of strategies and bahot sari bakchodi. I always want to ahead of everyone but hardly 1% times, it happened in this period. 
             Great people's biographies give insight for leave life stronger with right decisions, make more money and explore the world. But main thing is their entire lifes learnings are they kept in a one book ie. 70-80 years of understanding about life.
  Value of one page - A life lessons of genius.

	You Learn More from Peoples: It’s also true har ek insan ek khuli kitab hai. Agar unse interact karoge toh chije aur bhi better dhang se samaz me aayengi.

	Kai Jindagiyan Jite hai:  Jab tum 1 movie dekh lete ho. Jab tum ek kitab padh lete ho.
tab tum kai jindigiyan ji lete ho. is chij ko tum halake me mat lena ki ek book ko padhane se kya hota hai. bhai tum ek puri jindagi jis insan ne ji hai us insan ki sari mehanat expreince's ko ji loge. Yah bahut hi intimeting aur chilling expreince hota hai agar tum chijo ko sahi dhang se samaz pa rahe ho toh. 
wrong mentality yah hai ki itane pages padh leta hun kyun ek pura kitab nahi, Kyun isaka sara maja nahi, pages bilkul bhi nahi matter karate. Kya tumane vah chij acchese
Ji li kya. Kya tumhare jahan me vah chij utar gai kya (hands-on) ho gayi kya yah matter karata hai. Yah kab possible hai jab book ke sath, content ke sath attachment
ban jaye

# Some thoughts on Reading Books


1. One book = 1 life
2. It doesn't matter which book you are reading the question is are connected and enjoying.
3. Dive it like You are Going to see new adventure of life.

1. The key is #practice. The information once you revise quickly it will stay longer with you.
     : don't consider burden actually its the key to greatness.
     : question hard ask yourself info and tail yourself as revision.
