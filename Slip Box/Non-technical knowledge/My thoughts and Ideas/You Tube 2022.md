After working so hard i didn't continue to do things. 

For a year i practiced well.  I also decided to different from crowd. I got succeeded for period of time in mind want able to continue to do it.


Reason :
- Crash of mobile phone and laptop 
- Lost momentum and faith around me


- Got chance to push in many things 
### Learning
- **Chahe jo marji ho jaye piche mat hato.** Hath me liya hai toh karke hi chodana hai
-  Peoples prshanaa / tane doesn't matters what matters is "**Your work i'm not done yet**"
