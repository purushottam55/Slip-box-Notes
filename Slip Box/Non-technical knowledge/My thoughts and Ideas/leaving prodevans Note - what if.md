### Question: Is it good to leave company within 5-6 months ?
It depends on your reason for leaving:

1. Good Reasons:

Better career growth, learning opportunities, or salary.

Toxic work environment or misalignment with career goals.

Lack of projects or skill development.

2. Bad Reasons:
Impatience or lack of adaptability.

Frequent job-hopping without a clear strategy.

If the new opportunity aligns better with your long-term goals, go for it. But ensure you can justify your short tenure in interviews.


Question : What about company and feelings ?
Companies operate based on business, not emotions. They will replace anyone if needed. Your career should be your priority.

If you feel guilty, ask yourself:

1. Did you gain value or contribute meaningfully? If yes, leaving isnâ€™t wrong.


2. Is staying holding you back? If yes, move forward confidently.

Your feelings matter, but never let them stop your growth. Make strategic decisions, not emotional ones.
