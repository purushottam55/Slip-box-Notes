Route in OCP
 
 
### **What is a Route in OCP?** 
 A **Route** is OpenShift’s way of giving your app a public URL (like `myapp.example.com`) so users can access it from outside the cluster. 

 #### **How It Works (Simply):** 
 1. **User** → Visits `https://myapp-apps.openshift.com` 
 2. **Route** → Forwards traffic to a **Service** (internal load balancer). 
 3. **Service** → Sends traffic to **Pods** (your running containers). 

 ---

 ### **How to Configure a Route?** 
 #### **1. Auto-Creation (Simplest Way)** 
 ```sh
 oc expose svc/my-service  # Creates a Route automatically
 ```
 - OpenShift assigns a default URL like: 
   `my-service-project.cluster.example.com` 

 #### **2. Manual Creation (Custom Control)** 
 ```sh
 oc create route edge --service=my-service --hostname=myapp.example.com
 ```
 - **Types of Routes**: 
   - `edge` (HTTPS with OpenShift’s cert) ← *Most common* 
   - `passthrough` (Your app handles HTTPS) 
   - `reencrypt` (HTTPS with OpenShift + app cert) 

 ---

 ### **Is the Route a Machine?** 
 ❌ **No!** It’s **not a VM or server**. 
 ✅ It’s a **traffic rule** in OpenShift’s router (which runs on pods). 

 #### **Where Does the Router Run?** 
 - OpenShift deploys **router pods** (usually on worker nodes). 
 - These pods act like a reverse proxy (like Nginx). 

 ---

 ### **Key Takeaways** 
 1. **Route = Public URL** for your app. 
 2. **Configured via CLI/YAML** (auto or manual). 
 3. **Router pods** handle traffic (not a physical machine). 

 🚀 **Example Flow**: 
 `Browser → Route → Service → Pods → Your App`

         • In simple Route means url



 ---------------

 - **In OCP:** Router = software (pod). 
 - **In general:** Router can be hardware *or* software.
